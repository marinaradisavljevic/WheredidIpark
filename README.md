A simple app designed to help you locate where you've parked your vehicle. Where did I park is based on Google Maps and
needs access to user's location in order to work. Save the exact location where you parked your vehicle and the app will show
a car marker on the map to show it. Share the location of your vehicle with someone else or simply ask the app to lead you to
your favorite navigation app that will start guiding you to your vehicle right away. In case you think additional info might 
help you orient, add a note to your saved location. If you parked in a garage, checking the "I am in a garage" check box will
collapse a series of options for you to define the garage level, zone, row, or even the exact parking spot in which you left
your vehicle. Tapping on the car marker will show you an info window saying that this is your car's location. Tapping on the 
info window will display all the info you saved in your note.
